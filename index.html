									Unfinished Food? It is a Donation For Rats
								</h2>

									Taking a look in the compost bin the first
									thing that catches your eye would be this
									perfectly wasted crust. Treated like how the
									US government treats second class citizens.

								<h3>Who Are the Ones Responsible?</h3>
								<p>
									Who cares if we are wasting food we can
									always just make more anyways. Composting?
									Who even does that we only have so much
									lunch time anyways.

								<h2>Food On The Stairs</h2>
								<p>
									There were people specifically these high
									schoolers who believed that littering food
									was a perfectly fine thing to do. Half-eaten
									sandwiches, discarded fruit would be
									carelessly thrown out with other garbage.

								<h3>
									Walking To the Trash Can Is Worse Than Mile
									Runs
								</h3>
								<p>
									Leaving unfinished food on the ground when
									the trash can is just few steps aways. Yeah,
									we are that lazy.

							"We are currently facing unprecedented supply chain
							challenges that impact manufacturing and
							distribution of some foods and ingredients. Other
							circumstances also arise on occasion, such as the
							inability to staff our schools. This means we
							sometimes need to serve a different meal than what
							is posted on the menu with little to no notice. This
							situation is out of our control and something that
							school districts all across the country are
							experiencing. We are doing our best every day to
							come up with solutions to these challenges,
							including working hard with our vendors to secure
							meals as published and minimize meal substitutions
							to our best ability."
